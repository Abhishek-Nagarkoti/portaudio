This package provides an interface to the PortAudio audio I/O library (http://www.portaudio.com/).

Currently, a version of OpenDefaultStream is supported; it returns a Stream that can be started and stopped.  Only float32 samples are currently supported.  Audio buffers are non-interleaved.  This should be sufficient for many basic uses.  If people express interest, I'll be glad to expand the interface.

The client receives and sends audio via a callback function, made possible by Roger Peppe's callback package (http://code.google.com/p/rog-go/source/browse/exp/callback).
